A VPN (Virtual Private Network) creates a secure and encrypted tunnel between a user's device and the internet. It masks the user's IP address and hides their internet activity from ISPs, hackers, and surveillance.

Key benefits of using a VPN:
- **Privacy**: Prevents tracking by websites and advertisers.
- **Security**: Encrypts data on public Wi-Fi networks (e.g., in airports or cafes).
- **Anonymity**: Hides real IP address and browsing history.
- **Bypass restrictions**: Access geo-blocked content or censored websites.
- **Remote access**: Allows employees to connect securely to a company’s internal network.

Types of VPNs:
1. **Remote access VPN** – For individual users connecting to private networks.
2. **Site-to-site VPN** – Connects entire networks (used in corporations).

Common VPN protocols:
- **OpenVPN**: Secure, open-source protocol.
- **IKEv2/IPSec**: Fast and stable, good for mobile.
- **WireGuard**: Modern, high-performance protocol.
- **L2TP/IPSec** and **PPTP**: Older and less secure (not recommended).

Risks and considerations:
- Free VPNs may log user data or inject ads.
- Not all VPNs encrypt DNS traffic (consider using secure DNS too).
- VPN does not make a user "invisible" – websites can still track via cookies or browser fingerprinting.

Using a reputable, no-log VPN provider ensures better security and performance.
