Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines document retrieval with generative models to produce factually grounded responses.

OpenAI's GPT models are a type of transformer-based language models capable of generating human-like text.

Vector embeddings are numerical representations of text that preserve semantic meaning and are used for similarity search.

FAISS is a library developed by Facebook AI that enables efficient similarity search over large datasets of vector embeddings.

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing inputs (prompts) that guide the behavior of a language model toward a specific goal.

Semantic search improves traditional keyword search by understanding the context and meaning of the query.

Large Language Models (LLMs) can hallucinate â€“ i.e., generate confident-sounding but factually incorrect information, making grounding important.

LangChain is a popular framework for building applications that use language models with external data or tools.

Knowledge grounding ensures that model outputs can be traced back to verified source documents.
