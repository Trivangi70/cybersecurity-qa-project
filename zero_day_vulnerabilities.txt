A zero-day vulnerability is a flaw in software that is unknown to the vendor and has not been patched. Hackers exploit it before the developer can fix it.

Zero-day attack lifecycle:
1. Discovery by attacker.
2. Exploitation before a patch exists.
3. Patch development after discovery.

Examples:
- 2021: Microsoft Exchange Server zero-days exploited by Hafnium group.
- 2017: EternalBlue exploit (used in WannaCry ransomware).

Defense:
- Keep systems updated.
- Use behavior-based threat detection.
- Limit privileges on systems.
