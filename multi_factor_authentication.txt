Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a security process that requires users to provide two or more verification factors to access a resource such as an application or online account.

MFA methods include:
1. Something you know (password, PIN)
2. Something you have (smartphone, security token)
3. Something you are (fingerprint, facial recognition)

MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if a password is compromised.

Examples of MFA:
- Logging into Gmail using a password + OTP sent to your phone.
- Using an authenticator app like Google Authenticator.
