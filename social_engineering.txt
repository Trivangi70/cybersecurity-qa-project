Social engineering is the art of manipulating people into giving up confidential information. It exploits human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities.

Common social engineering techniques:
- Pretexting: Creating a fabricated scenario to steal data.
- Baiting: Leaving infected USBs or files to lure users.
- Tailgating: Gaining physical access by following authorized personnel.
- Impersonation: Pretending to be someone trustworthy.

Prevention tips:
- Be cautious of unsolicited requests for sensitive information.
- Verify identities through alternate channels.
- Educate employees about social engineering tactics.
