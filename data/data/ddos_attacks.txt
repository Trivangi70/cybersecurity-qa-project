A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack attempts to make an online service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources.

Types of DDoS attacks:
- Volume-based: Floods with high traffic (e.g., UDP floods).
- Protocol-based: Exploits server resources (e.g., SYN floods).
- Application layer: Targets specific web apps (e.g., HTTP requests).

Signs of DDoS:
- Slowed website performance.
- Unavailable services.
- Traffic spikes from unusual sources.

Prevention:
- Use a content delivery network (CDN).
- Enable rate limiting.
- Deploy DDoS protection tools.
