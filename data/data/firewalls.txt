A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing traffic based on security rules.

Types of firewalls:
- Packet-filtering firewall: Inspects packets and allows/discards based on rules.
- Stateful inspection firewall: Tracks active connections and filters traffic.
- Proxy firewall: Filters traffic at the application level.
- Next-generation firewall (NGFW): Combines traditional firewall with intrusion prevention and other features.

Benefits:
- Blocks unauthorized access.
- Protects against certain types of malware and attacks.
- Can log and analyze traffic.
