Encryption converts readable data into coded format to prevent unauthorized access.
Only users with the correct decryption key can access the information.
It protects sensitive data in storage and during transmission.
Common encryption methods include AES, RSA, and SSL/TLS.
Encryption is essential for secure communication and data privacy.

Encryption is the process of converting plaintext data into an unreadable format called ciphertext. This ensures that only authorized users can access the original information.

There are two main types of encryption:
1. **Symmetric encryption** – The same key is used for both encryption and decryption. Example: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).
2. **Asymmetric encryption** – Uses a public key to encrypt and a private key to decrypt. Example: RSA.

Encryption is essential for:
- **Data privacy**: Protects personal and sensitive information from unauthorized access.
- **Secure communication**: Ensures confidentiality over the internet (e.g., HTTPS).
- **Compliance**: Helps meet regulatory standards like GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS.

Common use cases:
- Email encryption (e.g., PGP)
- Secure file storage
- Encrypted messaging apps (e.g., Signal, WhatsApp)
- Database encryption in enterprises

Best practices:
- Use strong encryption algorithms like AES-256.
- Manage and store keys securely (e.g., Hardware Security Modules).
- Regularly update encryption protocols to prevent exploitation.
