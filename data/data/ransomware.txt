Ransomware is a type of malicious software designed to block access to a computer system or data, typically by encrypting it, until a ransom is paid. It spreads through email attachments, malicious downloads, or exploiting system vulnerabilities.

Common types of ransomware:
- Crypto ransomware: Encrypts files and demands payment for decryption.
- Locker ransomware: Locks users out of their devices entirely.
- Scareware: Fake software pretending to find issues and demanding money.

Prevention tips:
- Regularly back up important data.
- Avoid clicking on unknown links or downloading suspicious attachments.
- Install security software and keep it updated.
- Disable macros in Microsoft Office files by default.
